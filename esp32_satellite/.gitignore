I was trying to find some debugging videos to add to the doc, and was watching one for esp, and he mentioned a sep debugger
so wanted to check
for our 362 lab as well, we had another FTDI chip right?
koopa — 9/15/25, 10:03 PM
Yes we did
Seems like the ESP32 s3 has debugging

AtharvaBhide — 9/15/25, 10:19 PM

koopa — 9/15/25, 10:20 PM
I’ll indepth look through it first thing tomorrow morning
But that sounds like a great idea
You rope Jain in?
AtharvaBhide — 9/15/25, 10:20 PM
Im just gonna send the links rn
AtharvaBhide — 9/16/25, 9:56 AM
Thoughts? Jain said it might be a lil too much for ppl
Was thinking of assigning ppl sections
koopa — 9/16/25, 9:57 AM
I will disagree with Jain on this. These people signed up and we have some time before real emedded C will be written
They need to have a good understanding
I have been going through it and none of it is too long. Most will skim it anyway right?
AtharvaBhide — 9/16/25, 10:01 AM
