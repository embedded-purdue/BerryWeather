BerryWeather is a smarthome-like weather station that measures localized backyard data (via sensors + ESP32) while also displaying broader city/state weather data (via Raspberry Pi).
The goal is to provide a cheaper, modular solution for weather monitoring â€” making localized data collection more accessible to communities and hobbyists.
